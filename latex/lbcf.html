<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >Courteous Reader,
<!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   It is now many years since divers of us (with other sober Christians then living and
walking in the way of the Lord that we professe) did conceive our selves to be under a
necessity of Publishing a Confession of our Faith, for the information, and satisfaction
of those, that did not throughly understand what our principles were, or had
entertained prejudices against our Profession, by reason of the strange representation
of them, by some men of note, who had taken very wrong measures, and
accordingly led others into misapprehensions, of us, and them: and this was
first put forth about the year, 1643. in the name of seven Congregations
then gathered in London; since which time, diverse impressions thereof have
been dispersed abroad, and our end proposed, in good measure answered,
inasmuch as many (and some of those men eminent, both for piety and learning)
were thereby satisfied, that we were no way guilty of those Heterodoxies and
fundamental errors, which had too frequently been charged upon us without
ground, or occasion given on our part. And forasmuch, as that Confession is not
now commonly to be had; and also that many others have since embraced
the same truth which is owned therein; it was judged necessary by us to
joyn together in giving a testimony to the world; of our firm adhering to
those wholesome Principles, by the publication of this which is now in your
hand.
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   And forasmuch as our method, and manner of expressing our sentiments, in this,
doth vary from the former (although the substance of the matter is the same) we shall
freely impart to you the reason and occasion thereof. One thing that greatly
prevailed with us to undertake this work, was (not only to give a full account
of our selves, to those Christians that differ from us about the subject of
Baptism, but also) the profit that might from thence arise, unto those that
have any account of our labors, in their instruction, and establishment in
the great truths of the Gospel; in the clear understanding, and steady belief
of which, our comfortable walking with God, and fruitfulness before him,
in all our ways, is most neerly concerned; and therefore we did conclude it
necessary to expresse our selves the more fully, and distinctly; and also to fix
on such a method as might be most comprehensive of those things which
we designed to explain our sense, and belief of; and finding no defect, in
this regard, in that fixed on by the assembly, and after them by those of
the Congregational way, we did readily conclude it best to retain the same
order in our present confession: and also, when we observed that those last
mentioned, did in their confession (for reasons which seemed of weight both
to themselves and others) choose not only to express their mind in words
concurrent with the former in sense, concerning all those articles wherein they were
agreed, but also for the most part without any variation of the terms we did in
                                                                          

                                                                          
like manner conclude it best to follow their example in making use of the
very same words with them both, in these articles (which are very many)
wherein our faith and doctrine is the same with theirs, and this we did, the
more abundantly, to manifest our consent with both, in all the fundamental
articles of the Christian Religion, as also with many others, whose orthodox
confessions have been published to the world; on behalf of the Protestants in
divers Nations and Cities: and also to convince all, that we have no itch to
clogge Religion with new words, but do readily acquiesce in that form of
sound words, which hath been, in consent with the holy Scriptures, used by
others before us; hereby declaring before God, Angels, &amp; Men, our hearty
agreement with them, in that wholesome Protestant Doctrine, which with so
clear evidence of Scriptures they have asserted: some things indeed, are in
some places added, some terms omitted, and some few changed, but these
alterations are of that nature, as that we need not doubt, any charge or suspition
of unsoundness in the faith, from any of our brethren upon the account of
them.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   In those things wherein we differ from others, we have exprest our selves with all
candor and plainness that none might entertain jealousie of ought secretly lodged in
our breasts, that we would not the world should be acquainted with; yet we hope we
have also observed those rules of modesty, and humility, as will render our freedom in
this respect inoffensive, even to those whose sentiments are different from
ours.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   We have also taken care to affix texts of Scripture, in the margin for the
confirmation of each article in our confession; in which work we have studiously
indeavoured to select such as are most clear and pertinent, for the proof of what is
asserted by us: and our earnest desire is, that all into whose hands this may come,
would follow that (never enough commended) example of the noble Bereans, who
searched the Scriptures daily, that they might find out whether the things preached to
them were so or not.
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   There is one thing more which we sincerely professe, and earnestly desire credence
in, viz. That contention is most remote from our design in all that we have done in
this matter: and we hope the liberty of an ingenuous unfolding our principles, and
opening our hearts unto our Brethren, with the Scripture grounds on which our faith
and practise leanes, will by none of them be either denyed to us, or taken ill from us.
Our whole design is accomplished, if we may obtain that Justice, as to be measured in
our principles, and practise, and the judgement of both by others, according to what
we have now published; which the Lord (whose eyes are as a flame of fire) knoweth to
be the doctrine, which with our hearts we must firmly believe, and sincerely
indeavour to conform our lives to. And oh that other contentions being laid
asleep, the only care and contention of all upon whom the name of our blessed
Redeemer is called, might for the future be, to walk humbly with their God,
                                                                          

                                                                          
and in the exercise of all Love and Meekness towards each other, to perfect
holyness in the fear of the Lord, each one endeavouring to have his conversation
such as becometh the Gospel; and also suitable to his place and capacity
vigorously to promote in others the practice of true Religion and undefiled
in the sight of God and our Father. And that in this backsliding day, we
might not spend our breath in fruitless complaints of the evils of others; but
may every one begin at home, to reform in the first place our own hearts,
and wayes; and then to quicken all that we may have influence upon, to the
same work; that if the will of God were so, none might deceive themselves,
by resting in, and trusting to, a form of Godliness, without the power of it,
and inward experience of the efficacy of those truths that are professed by
them.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   And verily there is one spring and cause of the decay of Religion in our day, which
we cannot but touch upon, and earnestly urge a redresse of; and that is the neglect of
the worship of God in Families, by those to whom the charge and conduct of them is
committed. May not the grosse ignorance, and instability of many; with the
prophaneness of others, be justly charged upon their Parents and Masters; who have
not trained them up in the way wherein they ought to walk when they were young?
but have neglected those frequent and solemn commands which the Lord hath laid
upon them so to catechize, and instruct them, that their tender years might be
seasoned with the knowledge of the truth of God as revealed in the Scriptures; and
also by their own omission of Prayer, and other duties of Religion in their
families, together with the ill example of their loose conversation, have inured
them first to a neglect, and then contempt of all Piety and Religion? we
know this will not excuse the blindness, or wickedness of any; but certainly it
will fall heavy upon those that have thus been the occasion thereof; they
indeed dye in their sins; but will not their blood be required of those under
whose care they were, who yet permitted them to go on without warning,
yea led them into the paths of destruction? and will not the diligence of
Christians with respect to the discharge of these duties, in ages past, rise up in
judgment against, and condemn many of those who would be esteemed such
now?
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   We shall conclude with our earnest prayer, that the God of all grace, will pour
out those measures of his holy Spirit upon us, that the profession of truth
may be accompanyed with the sound belief, and diligent practise of it by us;
that his name may in all things be glorified, through Jesus Christ our Lord,
Amen.

      all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience, although the light of nature,
      and the works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness,
      wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet are they not
      sufficient to give that knowledge of God and his will which is necessary
      unto salvation. Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times and in divers
      manners to reveal himself, and to declare that his will unto his church; and
      afterward for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the
      more sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption
      of the flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the world, to commit the
      same wholly unto writing; which maketh the Holy Scriptures to be most

<!--l. 916--><p class="noindent" >Whosoever reads, and impartially considers what we have in our forgoing confession
declared, may readily perceive, That we do not only concenter with all other true
Christians on the Word of God (revealed in the Scriptures of truth) as the foundation
and rule of our faith and worship. But that we have also industriously endeavoured
to manifest, That in the fundamental Articles of Christianity we mind the
same things, and have therefore expressed our belief in the same words, that
have on the like occasion been spoken by other societies of Christians before
us.
<!--l. 918--><p class="indent" >   This we have done, That those who are desirous to know the principles of Religion
which we hold and practise, may take an estimate from our selves (who jointly
concur in this work) and may not be misguided, either by undue reports; or
by the ignorance or errors of particular persons, who going under the same
name with our selves, may give an occasion of scandalizing the truth we
profess.
<!--l. 920--><p class="indent" >   And although we do differ from our brethren who are Paedobaptists; in the
subject and administration of Baptisme, and such other circumstances as
have a necessary dependence on our observance of that Ordinance, and do
frequent our own assemblies for our mutual edification, and discharge of those
duties, and services which we owe unto God, and in his fear to each other:
yet we would not be from hence misconstrued, as if the discharge of our
own consciences herein, did any wayes disoblige or alienate our affections, or
conversation from any others that fear the Lord; but that we may and do as we have
opportunity participate of the labors of those, whom God hath indued with
abilities above our selves, and qualified, and called to the Ministry of the Word,
earnestly desiring to approve our selves to be such, as follow after peace with
holyness, and therefore we alwaies keep that blessed Irenicum, or healing
Word of the Apostle before our eyes; if in any thing ye be otherwise minded,
God shall reveal even this unto you; nevertheless whereto we have already
attained; let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing, Phil 3. v. 15,
16.
<!--l. 922--><p class="indent" >   Let it not therefore be judged of us (because much hath been written on this
subject, and yet we continue this our practise different from others) that it is out of
obstinacy, but rather as the truth is, that we do herein according to the best of our
understandings worship God, out of a pure mind yielding obedience to his precept, in
that method which we take to be most agreeable to the Scriptures of truth, and
primitive practise.
<!--l. 924--><p class="indent" >   It would not become us to give any such intimation, as should carry a semblance
that what we do in the service of God is with a doubting conscience, or with any such
temper of mind that we do thus for the present, with a reservation that we will do
otherwise hereafter upon more mature deliberation; nor have we any cause so to do,
                                                                          

                                                                          
being fully perswaded, that what we do is agreeable to the will of God. Yet we do
heartily propose this, that if any of the Servants of our Lord Jesus shall, in the Spirit
of meekness, attempt to convince us of any mistake either in judgement or practise,
we shall diligently ponder his arguments; and accompt him our chiefest friend that
shall be an instrument to convert us from any error that is in our ways, for
we cannot wittingly do any thing against the truth, but all things for the
truth.
<!--l. 926--><p class="indent" >   And therefore we have indeavoured seriously to consider, what hath been already
offered for our satisfaction in this point; and are loth to say any more lest we should
be esteemed desirous of renewed contests thereabout: yet forasmuch as it may justly
be expected that we shew some reason, why we cannot acquiesce in what hath been
urged against us; we shall with as much brevity as may consist with plainness,
endeavour to satisfie the expectation of those that shall peruse what we now publish
in this matter also.

<!--l. 929--><p class="noindent" >As to those Christians who consent with us, That Repentance from dead works, and
Faith towards God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, is required in persons to be
Baptized; and do therefore supply the defect of the (infant being uncapable of
making confession of either) by others who do undertake these things for it.
Although we do find by Church history that this hath been a very antient
practise; yet considering, that the same Scripture which does caution us against
censuring our brother, with whom we shall all stand before the judgment seat of
Christ, does also instruct us, That every one of us shall give an accompt
of himself to God, and whatsoever is not of Faith is Sin. Rom. 14:4, 10,
12, 23. Therefore we cannot for our own parts be perswaded in our own
minds, to build such a practise as this, upon an unwritten tradition: But do
rather choose in all points of Faith and Worship, to have recourse to the
holy Scriptures, for the information of our judgment, and regulation of our
practise; being well assured that a conscientious attending thereto, is the
best way to prevent, and rectifie our defects and errors. 2 Tim. 3. 16,17.
And if any such case happen to be debated between Christians, which is
not plainly determinable by the Scriptures, we think it safest to leave such
things undecided until the second coming of our Lord Jesus; as they did in the
Church of old, until there should arise a Priest with Urim and Thummim, that
might certainly inform them of the mind of God thereabout, Ezra 2. 62,
63.

baptism, upon a presumed faederal Holiness, or Church-Membership, we conceive they

Infant baptism does immediately and directly result from such a quality, or
relation.
<!--l. 934--><p class="indent" >   All instituted Worship receives its sanction from the precept, and is to be thereby

whereof was appropriated only to the Male, notwithstanding that the female seed as
well as the Male were comprehended in the Covenant and part of the Church of God;
neither was this sign to be affixed to any Male Infant till he was eight dayes old, albeit
he was within the Covenant from the first moment of his life; nor could the danger
of death, or any other supposed necessity, warrant the circumcising of him
before the set time, nor was there any cause for it; the commination of being
cut off from his people, being only upon the neglect, or contempt of the
precept.
<!--l. 938--><p class="indent" >   Righteous Lot was nearly related to Abraham in the flesh, and contemporary with
him, when this Covenant was made; yet inasmuch as he did not descend from his
loynes, nor was of his houshold family (although he was of the same houshold of faith

comprehensive of all the faithful in the world) yet the sign of this Covenant was
not affixed to all the persons that were within this Covenant, nor to any
of them till the prefixt season; nor to other faithful servants of God, that
were not of descent from Abraham. And consequently that it depends purely
upon the will of the Law-giver, to determine what shall be the sign of his
Covenant, unto whom, at what season, and upon what terms, it shall be
affixed.
<!--l. 942--><p class="indent" >   If our brethren do suppose baptism to be the seal of the Covenant which God
makes with every beleiver (of which the Scriptures are altogether silent) it is not our
concern to contend with them herein; yet we conceive the seal of that Covenant is the
indwelling of the Spirit of Christ in the particular and individual persons in whom he
resides, and nothing else, neither do they or we suppose that baptism is in any
                                                                          

                                                                          
such manner substituted in the place of circumcision, as to have the same
(and no other) latitude, extent, or terms, then circumcision had; for that was
suited only for the Male children, baptism is an ordinance suited for every
beleiver, whether male, or femal. That extended to all the males that were
born in Abrahams house, or bought with his money, equally with the males
that proceeded from his own loynes; but baptisme is not so far extended in
any true Christian Church that we know of, as to be administred to all the
poor infidel servants, that the members thereof purchase for their service,
and introduce into their families; nor to the children born of them in their
house.
<!--l. 944--><p class="indent" >   But we conceive the same parity of reasoning may hold for the ordinance of
baptism as for that of circumcision; Exodus 12.49. viz. one law for the stranger,
as for the home born: If any desire to be admitted to all the ordinances,
and priviledges of Gods house, the door is open; upon the same terms that
any one person was ever admitted to all, or any of those priviledges, that
belong to the Christian Church; may all persons of right challenge the like
admission.
<!--l. 946--><p class="indent" >   As for that text of Scripture, Rom. 4. 11. He received circumcision a seal of the
righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised; we conceive if the
Apostles scope in that place be duly attended to, it will appear that no argument can
be taken from thence to inforce Infant baptism; and forasmuch as we find a full and
fair account of those words given by the learned Dr. Lighfoot (a man not to be
suspected of partiality in this controversie) in his Hor. Hebrai, on the I Cor. 7. 19.
p.42, 43. we shall transcribe his words at large, without any comment of our own upon
them.
<!--l. 948--><p class="indent" >   Circumcision is nothing, if we respect the time, for now it was without use, that
end of it being especially fulfilled; for which it had been instituted: this end the
Apostle declares in these words, Rom. 4.11 . But I fear that by most translations they
are not sufficiently suited to the end of circumcision, and the scope of the Apostle
whilst something of their own is by them inserted.
<!--l. 950--><p class="indent" >   And after the Doctor hath represented diverse versions of the words agreeing
for the most part in sense with that which we have in our Bibles he thus
proceeds.
<!--l. 952--><p class="indent" >   Other versions are to the same purpose; as if circumcision was given to Abraham
for a Seal of that Righteousness which he had being yet uncircumcised, which we will
not deny to be in some sense true, but we believe that circumcision had chiefly a far
different respect.
<!--l. 954--><p class="indent" >   Give me leave thus to render the words; And he received the sign of circumcision,
a seal of the Righteousness of Faith, which was to be in the uncircumcision,
Which was to be (I say) not which had been, not that which Abraham had
whilst he was yet uncircumcised; but that which his uncircumcised seed should
                                                                          

                                                                          
have, that is the Gentiles, who in time to come should imitate the faith of
Abraham.
<!--l. 956--><p class="indent" >   Now consider well on what occasion circumcision was instituted unto Abraham,
setting before thine eyes the history thereof, Gen. 17.
<!--l. 958--><p class="indent" >   This promise is first made unto him, Thou shalt be the Father of many Nations (in
what sense the Apostle explaineth in that chapter) and then there is subjoined a
double seal for the confirmation of the thing, to wit, the change of the name Abram
into Abraham, and the institution of circumcision. v4. Behold as for me, my Covenant
is with thee, and thou shalt be the Father of many Nations. Wherefore was his name
called Abraham? for the sealing of this promise. Thou shalt be the Father of many
Nations. And wherefore was circumcision instituted to him? For the sealing of the
same promise. Thou shalt be the Father of many Nations. So that this is
the sense of the Apostle; most agreeable to the institution of circumcision;
he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the Righteousness of Faith
which in time to come the uncircumcision (or the Gentiles) should have and
obtain.
<!--l. 960--><p class="indent" >   Abraham had a twofold seed, natural, of the Jews; and faithful, of the believing
Gentiles: his natural seed was signed with the sign of circumcision, first indeed for the
distinguishing of them from all other Nations whilst they as yet were not the seed of
Abraham, but especially for the memorial of the justification of the Gentiles by faith,
when at length they should become his seed. Therefore circumcision was of
right to cease, when the Gentiles were brought in to the faith, forasmuch as
then it had obtained its last and chief end, &amp; thenceforth circumcision is
nothing.
<!--l. 962--><p class="indent" >   Thus far he, which we earnestly desire may be seriously weighed, for we plead not
his authority, but the evidence of truth in his words.

<!--l. 965--><p class="noindent" >Of whatsoever nature the holiness of the children mentioned, 1 Cor. 7. 12. be, yet
they who do conclude that all such children (whether Infants or of riper years) have
from hence an immediate right to baptism, do as we conceive put more into the
conclusion, then will be found in the premisses.
<!--l. 967--><p class="indent" >   For although we do not determine positively concerning the Apostles scope in the
holiness here mentioned, so as to say it is this, or that, and no other thing; Yet it is
evident that the Apostle does by it determine not only the lawfulness but the
expedience also of a beleivers cohabitation with an unbeliever, in the state of
marriage.
<!--l. 969--><p class="indent" >   And we do think that although the Apostles asserting of the unbelieving yokefellow
                                                                          

                                                                          
to be sanctified by the believer, should carry in it somewhat more then is in the bare
marriage of two infidels, because although the marriage covenant have a
divine sanction so as to make the wedlock of two unbelievers a lawful action,
and their conjunction and cohabitation in that respect undefiled, yet there
might be no ground to suppose from thence, that both or either of their
persons are thereby sanctified; and the Apostle urges the cohabitation of a
believer with an infidel in the state of wedlock from this ground that the
unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife; nevertheless here
you have the influence of a believers faith ascending from an inferior to a
superior relation; from the wife to the husband who is her head, before it can
descend to their off-spring. And therefore we say, whatever be the nature or
extent of the holiness here intended, we conceive it cannot convey to the
children an immediate right to baptism; because it would then be of another
nature, and of a larger extent, then the root, and original from whence it
is derived, for it is clear by the Apostles argument that holiness cannot be
derived to the child from the sanctity of one parent only, if either father or
mother be (in the sense intended by the Apostle) unholy or unclean, so will the
child be also, therefore for the production of an holy seed it is necessary
that both the Parents be sanctified; and this the Apostle positively asserts in
the first place to be done by the beleiving parent, although the other be an
unbeliever; and then consequentially from thence argues, the holiness of their
children. Hence it follows, that as the children have no other holiness then what
they derive from both their Parents; so neither can they have any right by
this holiness to any spiritual priviledge but such as both their Parents did
also partake of: and therefore if the unbelieving Parent (though sanctified by
the believing Parent) have not thereby a right to baptism, neither can we
concieve, that there is any such priviledge, derived to the children by their
birth-holiness.
<!--l. 971--><p class="indent" >   Besides if it had been the usual practice in the Apostles dayes for the father or
mother that did beleive, to bring all their children with them to be baptised; then the
holiness of the beleiving Corinthians children, would not at all have been in question
when this Epistle was written; but might have been argued from their passing under
that ordinance, which represented their new birth, although they had derived no
holiness from their Parents, by their first birth; and would have layen as an exception
against the Apostles inference, else were your Children unclean, &amp;c. But of
the sanctification of all the children of every beleiver by this ordinance, or
any other way, then what is beforementioned, the Scripture is altogether
silent.
<!--l. 973--><p class="indent" >   This may also be added; that if this birth holiness do qualifie all the children of
every believer, for the ordinance of baptism; why not for all other ordinances? for the
Lords Supper as was practiced for a long time together? for if recourse be had to what
                                                                          

                                                                          
the Scriptures speak generally of this subject; it will be found, that the same qualities
which do intitle any person to baptism, do so also for the participation of all the
Ordinances, and priviledges of the house of God, that are common to all
believers.
<!--l. 975--><p class="indent" >   Whosoever can and does interrogate his good Conscience towards God when he is
baptised (as every one must do that makes it to himself a sign of Salvation)
is capable of doing the same thing, in every other act of worship that he
performs.

<!--l. 978--><p class="noindent" >The arguments and inferences that are usually brought for, or against Infant baptism
from those few instances which the Scriptures afford us of whole families being
baptised; are only conjectural; and therefore cannot of themselves, be conclusive on
either hand: yet in regard most that treat on this subject for Infant baptism, do (as
they conceive) improve these instances to the advantage of their argument: we think it
meet (in like manner as in the cases before mentioned so in this) to shew the invalidity
of such inferences.
<!--l. 980--><p class="indent" >   Cornelius worshipped God with all his house, the Jaylor, and Crispus the chief ruler
of the Synagogue, believed God with each of their houses. The houshold of Stephanus
addicted themselves to the Ministry of the Saints: so that thus far Worshipping, and
Believing runs parallel with Baptism. And if Lydia, had been a married person, when
she believed, it is probable her husband would also have been named by the Apostle,
as in like cases, inasmuch as he would have been not only a part, but the head of that
baptised houshold.
<!--l. 982--><p class="indent" >   Who can assign any probable reason, why the Apostle should make mention of
four or five housholds being baptised and no more? or why he does so often vary in
the method of his salutations, Rom. 1. 6. sometimes mentioning only particular
persons of great note, other times such, and the Church in their house? the Saints
that were with them; and them belonging to Narcissus, who were in the Lord; thus
saluting either whole families, or part of families, or only particular persons in
families, considered as they were in the Lord, for if it had been an usual practise
to baptize all children, with their parents; there were then many thousands
of the Jews which believed, and a great number of the Gentiles, in most
of the principle Cities in the World, and among so many thousands, it is
more then probable there would have been some thousands of housholds
baptised; why then should the Apostle in this respect signalize one family
of the Jews and three or four of the Gentiles, as particular instances in a
case that was common? whoever supposes that we do willfully debar our
                                                                          

                                                                          
children, from the benefit of any promise, or priviledge, that of right belongs to
the children of believing parents; they do entertain over severe thoughts of
us: to be without natural affections is one of the characters of the worst
of persons; in the worst of times. Wee do freely confesse our selves guilty
before the Lord, in that we have not with more circumspection and diligence
train&#8217;d up those that relate to us in the fear of the Lord; and do humbly and
earnestly pray, that our omissions herein may be remitted, and that they
may not redound to the prejudice of our selves, or any of ours: but with
respect to that duty that is incumbent on us, we acknowledge our selves
obliged by the precepts of God, to bring up our children in the nurture and
admonition of the Lord, to teach them his fear, both by instruction and example;
and should we set light by this precept, it would demonstrate that we are
more vile then the unnatural Heathen, that like not to retain God in their
knowledge, our baptism might then be justly accompted, as no baptism to
us.
<!--l. 984--><p class="indent" >   There are many special promises that do incourage us as well as precepts, that do
oblige us to the close pursuit of our duty herein: that God whom we serve, being
jealous of his Worship, threatens the visiting of the Fathers transgression upon
the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate him: yet
does more abundantly extend his mercy, even to thousands (respecting the
offspring and succeding generations) of them that love him, and keep his
commands.
<!--l. 986--><p class="indent" >   When our Lord rebuked his disciples for prohibiting the access of little children that
were brought to him, that he might pray over them, lay his hands upon them, and
blesse them, does declare, that of such is the Kingdom of God. And the
Apostle Peter in answer to their enquiry, that desired to know what they
must do to be saved, does not only instruct them in the necessary duty of
repentance and baptism; but does also thereto encourage them, by that promise
which had reference both to them, and their children; if our Lord Jesus in the
forementioned place, do not respect the qualities of children (as elsewhere)
as to their meekness, humility, and sincerity, and the like; but intend also
that those very persons and such like, appertain to the Kingdom of God,
and if the Apostle Peter in mentioning the aforesaid promise, do respect
not only the present and succeeding generations of those Jews, that heard
him, (in which sense the same phrase doth occurre in Scripture) but also the
immediate off-spring of his auditors; whether the promise relate to the gift of
the Holy Spirit, or of eternal life, or any grace, or priviledge tending to the
obtaining thereof; it is neither our concerne nor our interest to confine the
mercies, and promises of God, to a more narrow, or lesse compasse then he is
pleased gratiously to offer and intend them; nor to have a light esteem of
them; but are obliged in duty to God, and affection to our children; to plead
                                                                          

                                                                          
earnestly with God and use our utmost endeavours that both our selves, and
our off-spring may be partakers of his Mercies and gracious Promises: yet
we cannot from either of these texts collect a sufficient warrant for us to
baptize our children before they are instructed in the principles of the Christian
Religion.
<!--l. 988--><p class="indent" >   For as to the instance in little children, it seems by the disciples forbidding
them, that they were brought upon some other account, not so frequent as
Baptism must be supposed to have been, if from the beginning believers children
had been admitted thereto: and no account is given whether their parents
were baptised believers or not; and as to the instance of the Apostle; if the
following words and practice, may be taken as an interpretation of the scope of
that promise we cannot conceive it does refer to infant baptism, because the
text does presently subjoyn; Then they that gladly received the word were
baptised.
<!--l. 990--><p class="indent" >   That there were some believing children of believing parents in the Apostles dayes
is evident from the Scriptures, even such as were then in ther fathers family, and under
their parents tuition, and education; to whom the Apostle in several of his Epistles to
the Churches, giveth commands to obey their parents in the Lord; and does allure
their tender years to hearken to this precept, by reminding them that it is the first
command with promise.
<!--l. 992--><p class="indent" >   And it is recorded by him for the praise of Timothy, and encouragement of parents
betimes to instaruct, and children early to attend to godly instruction, that from a
child, he had known the holy Scriptures.
<!--l. 994--><p class="indent" >   The Apostle John rejoyced greatly when he found of the children of the Elect Lady
walking in the truth; and the children of her Elect Sister joyn with the Apostle in his
salutation.
<!--l. 996--><p class="indent" >   But that this was not generally so, that all the children of believers were accounted
for believers (as they would have been if they had been all baptised) may be collected
from the character which the Apostle gives of persons fit to be chosen to Eldership in
the Church which was not common to all believers; among others this is expressely
one, viz. If there be any having believing, or faithful children, not accused of Riot or
unruly; and we may from the Apostles writings on the same subject collect the reason
of this qualification, viz. That in case the person designed for this office to
teach and rule in the house of God, had children capable of it; there might
be first a proof of his ability, industry, and successe in this work in his own
family; and private capacity, before he was ordained to the exercise of this
authority in the Church, in a publick capacity, as a Bishop in the house of
God.
<!--l. 998--><p class="indent" >   These things we have mentioned as having a direct reference unto the controversie
between our brethren and us; other things that are more abstruse and prolix, which are
frequently introduced into this controversie, but do not necessarily concern it, we have
                                                                          

                                                                          
purposely avoided; that the distance between us and our brethren may not be by us
made more wide; for it is our duty, and concern so far as is possible for us (retaining a
good conscience towards God) to seek a more entire agreement and reconciliation
with them.
<!--l. 1000--><p class="indent" >   We are not insenible that as to the order of Gods house, and entire communion
therein there are some things wherein we (as well as others) are not at a full accord
among our selves, as for instance; the known principle, and state of the consciences of
diverse of us, that have agreed in this Confession is such; that we cannot hold
Church-communion, with any other then Baptized-believers, and Churches constituted
of such; yet some others of us have a greater liberty and freedom in our spirits that
way; and therefore we have purposely omitted the mention of things of that nature,
that we might concurre, in giving this evidence of our agreement, both among
our selves, and with other good Christians, in those important articles of
the Christian Religion, mainly insisted on by us: and this notwithstanding
we all esteem it our chief concern, both among our selves, and all others
that in every place call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ our Lord,
both theirs and ours, and love him in sincerity, to endeavour to keep the
unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace; and in order thereunto, to exercise
all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in
love.
<!--l. 1002--><p class="indent" >   And we are perswaded if the same method were introduced into frequent practice
between us and our Christian friends who agree with us in all the fundamental articles
of the Christian faith (though they do not so in the subject and administration of
baptism) it would soon beget a better understanding, and brotherly affection between
us.
<!--l. 1004--><p class="indent" >   In the beginning of the Christian Church, when the doctrine of the baptism of
Christ was not universally understood, yet those that knew only the baptism of John,
were the Disciples of the Lord Jesus; and Apollos an eminent Minister of the Gospel of
Jesus.
<!--l. 1006--><p class="indent" >   In the beginning of the reformation of the Christian Church, and recovery from
that Egyptian darkness wherein our forefathers for many generations were held in
bondage; upon recourse had to the Scriptures of truth, different apprehensions were
conceived, which are to this time continued, concerning the practise of this
Ordinance.
<!--l. 1008--><p class="indent" >   Let not our zeal herein be misinterpreted: that God whom we serve is jealous of his
worship. By his gracious providence the Law thereof, is continued amongst us; and we
are forewarned by what hapned in the Church of the Jews, that it is necessary for
every generation, and that frequently in every generation to consult the divine oracle,
compare our worship with the rule, and take heed to what doctrines we receive and
practise.

forbidding Idolatry had been utterly lost.

parts of Gods law, and his worship; the Feast of Tabernacles (which for many
centuries of years, had not been duly observed, according to the institution,
though it was retained in the general notion) would not have been kept in due
order.
<!--l. 1014--><p class="indent" >   So may it be now as to many things relating to the service of God, which do retain
the names proper to them in their first institution, but yet through inadvertency
(where there is no sinister design) may vary in their circumstances, from their first
institution. And if by means of any antient defection, or of that general corruption of
the service of God, and interruption of his true worship, and persecution of his
servants by the Antichristian Bishop of Rome, for many generations; those who do
consult the Word of God, cannot yet arrive at a full and mutual satisfaction among
themselves, what was the practise of the primitive Christian Church, in some points
relating to the Worship of God: yet inasmuch as these things are not of the essence of
Christianity, but that we agree in the fundamental doctrines thereof, we do
apprehend, there is sufficient ground to lay aside all bitterness and prejudice, and
in the spirit of love and meekness to imbrace and own each other therein;
leaving each other at liberty to perform such other services, (wherein we
cannot concur) apart unto God, according to the best of our understanding.
